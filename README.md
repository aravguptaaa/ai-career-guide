# AI Career Guidance Platform

This project is an end-to-end AI-powered platform that analyzes resumes, matches them to relevant job descriptions using semantic search, and generates personalized career advice with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline running on a local LLM.


# Key Features

- Resume Parsing:** Upload a PDF or DOCX resume and automatically extract skills, name, and email using spaCy.
- Semantic Job Matching:** Instead of keywords, it uses sentence embeddings to find jobs based on contextual meaning.
- AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverages a local LLM (Phi-3) to provide a detailed skill-gap analysis, identify strengths, and suggest a personalized learning plan.
- 100% Open-Source & Local:** Runs entirely on your machine for free, with no API keys required.

# Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **AI Orchestration:** LangChain
- **LLM:** Ollama with `phi3:mini`
- **NLP & Parsing:** spaCy, PyPDF2, python-docx
- **Semantic Search (RAG):** Sentence-Transformers, ChromaDB, scikit-learn
- **Data Handling:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
